We all ask to be manipulated because it so obviously works. Fact is government has little influence on the broader economy. Harper is no more responsible for our current doldrums than he would be if were enjoying a nice pleasant 3% growth rate. Indeed, if Harper can control the economy then why did we have a downturn? Truth is he can't. Nor can Trudeau or Mulcair. Why we assign our political leaders influence on this is beyond me.However, it is quite normal in times of economic downturns for governments to run deficits so as to alleviate the problem to a degree. Cutting spending in order to have a balanced budget in such circumstances makes things worse as every economist knows. Fact is, we all like things for free - limitless government services, no taxes and unicorn rides for all. Harper deceptions on this file, as on so many others, has rendered reasoned debate nearly impossible.

Then Mr Trudeau needs to have the same conversation with the premiers. That doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of carbon taxes, but it certainly means making them genuinely revenue neutral. That means returning all the revenue to individuals and corporations in the form of reduced taxes, including corporate taxes and regulatory costs, to maintain competitiveness. That's what economists who proposed carbon taxes originally had in mind, rather than treating carbon taxes as a big sin tax that goes into general revenues for addressing deficits and paying for pet projects, as our governments tend to regard them. Otherwise, we jeopardize Canadian competitiveness and prosperity. Arrogantly and contemptuously dismissing these concerns as not worthy of consideration in comparison to the fate of the earth or whatever will just increase the likelihood of Canada producing its own Trump three or four years from now. For the long term, we need not only to defend the Canada-US free trade agreement, even if it is modified in some way, but to expand our trade connections with other countries. CETA is a good start. However it is also important to grow our own internal market. That means eliminating interprovincial barriers to trade in goods and services. Here Mr Trudeau needs to start knocking some provincial premier heads. And it means increasing Canada's population. The advantage of increased population, so long as it is a productive population that isn't just an overall drain on resources, is that it increases the internal market and makes it less susceptible to the inevitable vicissitudes of foreign trade and isolationist eruptions elsewhere. That's a great advantage the United States and Europe have and Canada lacks.

What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long.

source1_32803341_79,"While your conclusion that Ms. Clinton lost the election because she is a woman may be valid, I think you're over-distilling a complex set of issues into a simple gender issue. Remember, Mr. Trump chewed his way through 16 other Republican contenders, most of them men, and probably all of them technically more qualified than he. Much of that spectacle occurred long before it was evident that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee. You assume, incorrectly, that America is a progressive society. While there are progressive segments, what this election demonstrated is the opposite. Sexism, racism and xenophobia are alive and doing very well there, particlarly in the Republican caucus. Further, politics is relentlessly self-serving, at the personal and party level. Also, especially since 2008, economic growth has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy. (That's a big issue on its own, but its relevance here is that the privileged are making the economic and political decisions to their own benefit while the underclass is falling farther behind.) For example, how can America's election campaign funding model be considered fair and democratic? Mr. Trump has ably exploited all these issues. Ms. Clinton, besides being a woman, also became the poster-person for the status quo. In effect her biggest asset - her vast experience - became a liability. Perhaps Bernie Sanders would have been a better adversary, not because he's a guy, but because he also was speaking out about the injustices being suffered by less privileged Americans. Those arguments worked very well for his popularity too, particularly among young women. And, since we're here, Ms. Clinton wasn't so overwhelmingly popular among those younger women. While one can argue with some validity that some women are against a female President, I'd venture that for many of them, other issues are in play. While it is fair to speak out against sexism (and racism and xenophobia) in America and elsewhere, my worry now is that Americans have elected a sorcerer's apprentice. How much damage can this apprentice do? I worry about increasing instability in eastern Europe (in particular). I worry about war over the South China Sea. I worry that the global ecosphere is in deeper trouble now, due to Mr Trump's inappropriate policies on climate change, habitat destruction and unsustainable, profit-driven, wasteful consumption of resources.
