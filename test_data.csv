32803341,"While your conclusion that Ms. Clinton lost the election because she is a woman may be valid, I think you're over-distilling a complex set of issues into a simple gender issue. Remember, Mr. Trump chewed his way through 16 other Republican contenders, most of them men, and probably all of them technically more qualified than he. Much of that spectacle occurred long before it was evident that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee. You assume, incorrectly, that America is a progressive society. While there are progressive segments, what this election demonstrated is the opposite. Sexism, racism and xenophobia are alive and doing very well there, particlarly in the Republican caucus. Further, politics is relentlessly self-serving, at the personal and party level. Also, especially since 2008, economic growth has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy. (That's a big issue on its own, but its relevance here is that the privileged are making the economic and political decisions to their own benefit while the underclass is falling farther behind.) For example, how can America's election campaign funding model be considered fair and democratic? Mr. Trump has ably exploited all these issues. Ms. Clinton, besides being a woman, also became the poster-person for the status quo. In effect her biggest asset - her vast experience - became a liability. Perhaps Bernie Sanders would have been a better adversary, not because he's a guy, but because he also was speaking out about the injustices being suffered by less privileged Americans. Those arguments worked very well for his popularity too, particularly among young women. And, since we're here, Ms. Clinton wasn't so overwhelmingly popular among those younger women. While one can argue with some validity that some women are against a female President, I'd venture that for many of them, other issues are in play. While it is fair to speak out against sexism (and racism and xenophobia) in America and elsewhere, my worry now is that Americans have elected a sorcerer's apprentice. How much damage can this apprentice do? I worry about increasing instability in eastern Europe (in particular). I worry about war over the South China Sea. I worry that the global ecosphere is in deeper trouble now, due to Mr Trump's inappropriate policies on climate change, habitat destruction and unsustainable, profit-driven, wasteful consumption of resources. I wonder what my granddaughter's life will look like in 40 years. Maybe she'll be Prime Minister, but what kind of world will she have to live in?",While conclusion Is Clinton lost election woman may valid I think distilling complex set issues simple gender issue Remember Or Trump chewed way 16 Republican contenders men probably technically qualified Much spectacle occurred long evident Is Clinton would Democratic nominee You assume incorrectly America progressive society While progressive segments election demonstrated opposite Sexism racism xenophobia alive well particlarly Republican caucus Further politics relentlessly self serving personal party level Also especially since 2008 economic growth disproportionately benefitted wealthy That big issue relevance privileged making economic political decisions benefit underclass falling farther behind For example America election campaign funding model considered fair democratic Or Trump ably exploited issues Is Clinton besides woman also became poster person status quo In effect biggest asset vast experience became liability Perhaps Bernie Sanders would better adversary guy also speaking injustices suffered less privileged Americans Those arguments worked well popularity particularly among young women And since Is Clinton overwhelmingly popular among younger women While one argue validity women female President I venture many issues play While fair speak sexism racism xenophobia America elsewhere worry Americans elected sorcerer apprentice How much damage apprentice I worry increasing instability eastern Europe particular I worry war South China Sea I worry global ecosphere deeper trouble due Or Trump inappropriate policies climate change habitat destruction unsustainable profit driven wasteful consumption resources I wonder granddaughter life look like 40 years Maybe Prime Minister kind world live

32803341,"As much as I found Trump's misogynous tripe repellant, I never gave it much weight in assessing Clinton's loss. What I did not like about Clinton the sense I got from her of 'entitlement', that the office was hers for the taking - and not just from her days as Secretary of State, or as a Senator, or from having been First Lady - it struck me, watching a documentary about the US presidential candidates that Clinton had her eyes set on 'the Office' from the time that she had been profiled in LIFE magazine at her College graduation. That uniquely American sense of 'Manifest Destiny' is not attractive - particularly when someone's asking for your help to achieve it. Now that's just my perception, but I believe that same arrogance was what led her (and her team) not to worry about the signals they'd received that they could lose votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Those states were lost by the thinnest of margins, and still, as it has been pointed out, Clinton won the popular vote. I felt that the 'feminist icon' trope was also odd, like a relic from a previous generation. I'm a man, working in a traditional male field (engineering) but I've always accepted and supported my female colleagues and managers. I will agree that the bemused tolerance of the masses was too easily interpreted as tacit approval of Trump's antics, until it was too late. I also agree that groups of people whose attitudes and behaviour sequestered them (rightfully) to an underclass in our society, have been emboldened. I doubt that they will remain that way for long. Nothing that Donald Trump can do will elevate these fools, or make their angry lives truly better. In much the same way, there was nothing that a Clinton victory would REALLY have done to make women's lives better - or guarantee them access to jobs that they would not have earned otherwise.",As much I found Trump misogynous tripe repellant I never gave much weight assessing Clinton loss What I like Clinton sense I got entitlement office taking days Secretary State Senator First Lady struck watching documentary US presidential candidates Clinton eyes set Office time profiled LIFE magazine College graduation That uniquely American sense Manifest Destiny attractive particularly someone asking help achieve Now perception I believe arrogance led team worry signals received could lose votes Wisconsin Pennsylvania Ohio Those states lost thinnest margins still pointed Clinton popular vote I felt feminist icon trope also odd like relic previous generation I man working traditional male field engineering I always accepted supported female colleagues managers I agree bemused tolerance masses easily interpreted tacit approval Trump antics late I also agree groups people whose attitudes behaviour sequestered rightfully underclass society emboldened I doubt remain way long Nothing Donald Trump elevate fools make angry lives truly better In much way nothing Clinton victory would REALLY done make women lives better guarantee access jobs would earned otherwise

The big danger is that this conflict could go from bellicose talk to actual war and this could easily start from a small incident in the South China Sea.",China angry country big chip shoulder It feels respected given proper place international order Add fact China aging paranoid rulers use trumped nationalism way deflect scrutiny activities recipe future conflict The big danger conflict could go bellicose talk actual war could easily start small incident South China Sea

32746841,"Mr Trudeau and his ministers need to put their various pet projects aside for the time being and sit down for a really serious discussion of the Canadian economy and the implications of Mr Trump's victory for it and what some of the scenarios look like. Then Mr Trudeau needs to have the same conversation with the premiers. That doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of carbon taxes, but it certainly means making them genuinely revenue neutral. That means returning all the revenue to individuals and corporations in the form of reduced taxes, including corporate taxes and regulatory costs, to maintain competitiveness. That's what economists who proposed carbon taxes originally had in mind, rather than treating carbon taxes as a big sin tax that goes into general revenues for addressing deficits and paying for pet projects, as our governments tend to regard them. Otherwise, we jeopardize Canadian competitiveness and prosperity. Arrogantly and contemptuously dismissing these concerns as not worthy of consideration in comparison to the fate of the earth or whatever will just increase the likelihood of Canada producing its own Trump three or four years from now. For the long term, we need not only to defend the Canada-US free trade agreement, even if it is modified in some way, but to expand our trade connections with other countries. CETA is a good start. However it is also important to grow our own internal market. That means eliminating interprovincial barriers to trade in goods and services. Here Mr Trudeau needs to start knocking some provincial premier heads. And it means increasing Canada's population. The advantage of increased population, so long as it is a productive population that isn't just an overall drain on resources, is that it increases the internal market and makes it less susceptible to the inevitable vicissitudes of foreign trade and isolationist eruptions elsewhere. That's a great advantage the United States and Europe have and Canada lacks. Faced with a situation like Mr Trump's victory, Mr Chretien and Mr Martin would have sat down for some blunt conversations with members of their own party and provincial counterparts , as they did concerning the implications of the deficit for Canadian prosperity. Mr Trudeau needs to show he is made of the same stuff.",Or Trudeau ministers need put various pet projects aside time sit really serious discussion Canadian economy implications Or Trump victory scenarios look like Then Or Trudeau needs conversation premiers That necessarily mean getting rid carbon taxes certainly means making genuinely revenue neutral That means returning revenue individuals corporations form reduced taxes including corporate taxes regulatory costs maintain competitiveness That economists proposed carbon taxes originally mind rather treating carbon taxes big sin tax goes general revenues addressing deficits paying pet projects governments tend regard Otherwise jeopardize Canadian competitiveness prosperity Arrogantly contemptuously dismissing concerns worthy consideration comparison fate earth whatever increase likelihood Canada producing Trump three four years For long term need defend Canada US free trade agreement even modified way expand trade connections countries BETA good start However also important grow internal market That means eliminating interprovincial barriers trade goods services Here Or Trudeau needs start knocking provincial premier heads And means increasing Canada population The advantage increased population long productive population overall drain resources increases internal market makes less susceptible inevitable vicissitudes foreign trade isolationist eruptions elsewhere That great advantage United States Europe Canada lacks Faced situation like Or Trump victory Or Chretien Or Martin would sat blunt conversations members party provincial counterparts concerning implications deficit Canadian prosperity Or Trudeau needs show made stuff
